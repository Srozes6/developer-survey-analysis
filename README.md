# Stack Overflow Developer Survey: Data Wrangling, EDA, Visualization & Dashboarding (Python)

An end-to-end analytics portfolio project using Python and Jupyter notebooks to **clean, explore, visualize, and summarize insights through dashboards**.  
This repository demonstrates a complete workflow aligned with real-world business and data analytics practices.

---

## Project Overview

This project uses survey and sales-style datasets to demonstrate:
- Data wrangling and validation
- Handling duplicates and missing values
- Feature normalization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Professional data visualization
- Simple dashboard design for executive-style insights

The notebooks are organized into **module-based labs**, each focusing on a core analytics skill.

## Module 2 — Data Wrangling

**Focus:** Preparing raw data for analysis

- Finding duplicate records
- Removing duplicates and validating results
- Identifying missing values
- Imputing missing values using appropriate strategies
- Normalizing numeric data
- End-to-end data wrangling lab

---

## Module 3 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Focus:** Understanding structure, patterns, and distributions

- Distribution analysis (spread, skew, frequency)
- Summary statistics
- Exploratory insights
- Supporting EDA documentation

---

## Module 4 — Data Visualization

**Focus:** Communicating insights clearly and effectively

Visualizations created using Python include:

- Bar charts
- Line charts
- Stacked charts
- Pie charts
- Scatter plots
- Bubble plots
- Box plots
- Histograms

These visuals are designed to highlight trends, comparisons, distributions, and relationships in the data.

## Module 5 — Dashboarding

**Focus:** High-level insight communication for decision-making

- **Simple Dashboard (PDF)**  
  A consolidated dashboard presenting:
  - Product line performance by year
  - Quantity sold trends across categories
  - Revenue summary metrics

This module demonstrates how analytical findings can be transformed into **executive-friendly dashboards** that support strategic decisions rather than raw analysis alone.

## Dataset

The notebooks reference datasets hosted through Skills Network / IBM and supporting lab materials, including:
- Survey datasets
- Sales-style product performance data

Links are embedded directly within the notebooks.
